To simplify the process and have a production-ready solution in a few minutes, we will use [CometChat React Native UI Kit](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/react-native-chat-ui-kit/overview).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. A text editor. (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, Sublime Text, Atom, or VIM)
2. React Native environment setup either iOS/Android.

## CometChat

I have to admit that one of my always wanted to build projects was a Chat App with Video Calls using React Native, and thanks to CometChat, that dream is now a reality, and you will fulfill the same today by following the steps of this guide.

We all know the difficulties of building an MVP or integrate Video Calls/Chat into an existing React Native project. There're a lot of things to take into consideration, especially when using Video Calls. Thanks to CometChat UI Kit, we can build such functionalities in a matter of minutes.
