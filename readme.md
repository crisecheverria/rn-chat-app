# Overview

Let's build a React Native Chat App to connect with Users & Groups, make Audio & Video Calls, send Text, Media Messages, and more.

![comet-chat-app](./screenshots/comet-chat-app.png)

To simplify the process and have a production-ready solution in a few minutes, we will use [CometChat React Native UI Kit](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/react-native-chat-ui-kit/overview).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. A text editor. (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, Sublime Text, Atom, or VIM)
2. React Native environment setup either iOS/Android.

## CometChat

I have to admit that one of my always wanted to build projects was a Chat App with Video Calls using React Native, and thanks to CometChat, that dream is now a reality, and you will fulfill the same today by following the steps of this guide.

We all know the difficulties of building an MVP or integrate Video Calls/Chat into an existing React Native project. There're a lot of things to take into consideration, especially when using Video Calls. Thanks to CometChat UI Kit, we can build such functionalities in a matter of minutes.

## Setup

First, you need to register on CometChat. Click [here](https://app.cometchat.com/signup) to Sign Up. Then you can create a New App based on your location. You can also choose CometChat API v2 or the most recent one, which is v3. For this guide, we will choose v3.

![comet-chat-new-app](./screenshots/comet-chat-new-app.png)

Once you create your new CometChat app, you will see the list of apps with essential information like **APP ID**, **Region**, and **Version**. We will use that information later when we initialize our React Native app with CometChat SDK.

### Create your React Native App

Open your terminal, and using npx, let's create our React Native Chat App. For this post, we will use React Native v0.66 I strongly recommend you use the same version to avoid compatibility issues with the libraries we will use.

```js
npx react-native init chatApp --version 0.66.0
```

Now, open chatApp using your favourite IDE/Text Editor, I will choose Visual Studio Code and also let's create a **src** folder in the root of our app. Move the file App.js from the root into src folder, remember to update the root index.js to reflect the location change of App.js

**./src/App.js**

```js
import React from 'react';
import {SafeAreaView, StatusBar, StyleSheet, Text, View} from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <StatusBar barStyle="dark-content" />
      <View style={styles.body}>
        <Text>Chat App</Text>
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },
  body: {
    paddingHorizontal: 10,
  },
});

export default App;
```

**./index.js**

```js
import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';
import App from './src/App'; // ðŸ‘ˆ
import {name as appName} from './app.json';

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
```

### Add CometChat Dependency

Open your terminal, and let's add CometChat Pro v3 package for React Native.

```js
npm install @cometchat-pro/react-native-chat@3.0.0 --save
```

Also, we need to add React Native Async Storage.

```js
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

#### Setup for iOS

For iOS, we only need to install the dependencies using Cocoa Pods for that you run `npx pod-install` and should be good to go.

#### Setup for Android

Now, for Android, we need to make a couple of adjustments. First, open **android/build.gradle** file, and we will update the buildScript.

```js
buildscript {
    ext {
        buildToolsVersion = "30.0.2"
        minSdkVersion = 24  // ðŸ‘ˆ Update the minSdkVersion to 24
        compileSdkVersion = 30
        targetSdkVersion = 30
        ndkVersion = "21.4.7075529"
    }
    ...
}
```

And inside allProjects add maven configuration for cometchat-prop-android.

```js
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven {
            url "https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/cometchat/cometchat-pro-android/maven/"
        }
    }
}
```

### Initialize CometChat inside your app

First, let's create a constants.js file in the root of our app with an object that we will export that contains our CometChat App APP_ID, REGION, and AUTH_KEY. Go into CometChat Dashboard and replace the values with your app settings.

**./constants.js**

```js
export const COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS = {
  APP_ID: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
  REGION: 'YOUR_REGION',
  AUTH_KEY: 'YOUR_AUTH_KEY',
};
```

Now, let's move into our app entrance file generally is recommended to use **./index.js** file.

```js
// Let's import CometChat and the constants created
import {CometChat} from '@cometchat-pro/react-native-chat';
import {COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS} from './constants';

// Setup App Settings and call CometChat init() method.
const appSetting = new CometChat.AppSettingsBuilder()
  .subscribePresenceForAllUsers()
  .setRegion(COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS.REGION)
  .build();
CometChat.init(COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS.APP_ID, appSetting).then(
  () => {
    console.warn('Initialization completed successfully');
    // You can now call warnin function.
  },
  error => {
    console.log('Initialization failed with error:', error);
    // Check the reason for error and take appropriate action.
  },
);
```

Once we finish setting our app and calling the init() method, we can test if everything runs fine. For that, we're going to use Simulators. If you're a Mac user, you can try both iPhone & Android simulators; otherwise, only the Android Simulator will work for you.

Open a terminal and run the Simulator for iOS:

```js
npx react-native run-ios
```

You should see the iPhone Simulator with the console.warn message we used inside the init() method if everything goes well.

![iphone simulator cometchat init](./screenshots/iphone-simulator-cometchat-init.png)

For Android run.

```js
npx react-native run-android
```

The result should be the same as the iPhone Simulator.

### Add UI Kit to your project

Next, let's clone CometChat React Native UI Kit repository on our local computer. Open a new terminal window and clone the following repository in another location. In my case, I will clone it in my Desktop folder:

```js
git clone https://github.com/cometchat-pro/cometchat-pro-react-native-ui-kit.git -b v3
```

Once you clone the UI Kit repository, let's create a new folder in the root of our app with the name of **cometchat-pro-react-native-ui-kit** and copy and paste all the folders and files we have inside the cloned repository `cometchat-pro-react-native-ui-kit/src` folder into our just created folder.

#### CometChat UI Kit Dependencies

To make the UI Kit work, we need to install a list of dependencies. And to make the process more petite prom to issues, I will give the list of dependencies that you will establish with the **same version**; otherwise, you probably will have problems.

```
"dependencies": {
    "@cometchat-pro/react-native-calls": "^2.1.1",
    "@cometchat-pro/react-native-chat": "^3.0.0",
    "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^1.15.9",
    "@react-native-picker/picker": "^1.9.4",
    "@react-navigation/bottom-tabs": "^5.11.2",
    "@react-navigation/native": "^5.8.10",
    "@react-navigation/stack": "^5.12.8",
    "emoji-mart-native": "^0.6.2-beta",
    "gravatar-api": "^1.5.0",
    "react": "17.0.2",
    "react-native": "0.66.0",
    "react-native-autolink": "^3.0.0",
    "react-native-document-picker": "^4.1.1",
    "react-native-elements": "^3.0.0-alpha.1",
    "react-native-fast-image": "^8.3.4",
    "react-native-gesture-handler": "^1.9.0",
    "react-native-image-picker": "^3.1.1",
    "react-native-keep-awake": "^4.0.0",
    "react-native-reanimated": "^1.13.3",
    "react-native-safe-area-context": "^3.1.9",
    "react-native-screens": "^2.16.1",
    "react-native-sound": "^0.11.0",
    "react-native-swipe-list-view": "^3.2.8",
    "react-native-vector-icons": "^7.1.0",
    "react-native-video": "^5.2.0-alpha1",
    "react-native-video-controls": "^2.7.1",
    "react-native-webview": "^11.14.1",
    "reanimated-bottom-sheet": "^1.0.0-alpha.22",
    "rn-fetch-blob": "^0.12.0",
    "rn-nodeify": "^10.3.0"
  }
```

Now, copy the list from above ðŸ‘† and replace it with the dependencies list you have in your **package.json** file in the app's root.

Now, let's remove the `node_modules` & the `package-lock.json` file and install all the dependencies one more time.

```
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

Have in mind that some of this libraries needs an extra step in order to finish the installation process for example:

- react-navigation (Android)

For iOS must of the setup is done by using Cocoa Pods. Let's start there and run `npx pod-install`.

And for Android, let's finish the react-navigation setup process, by opeong the file `android/app/src/main/java/com/chatapp/MainActivity.java` and this is mostly because of the react-navigation version we use for this guide wich is v5.X

```js
...
import android.os.Bundle;

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {
  ...

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(null);
  }
}
```

Remember that we used specific versions of the libraries, and I recommend you use the identical versions I used. If you still want to try the latest versions, you're free to do it. I hope you won't find too many issues ðŸ˜‰
